<h1 align="center">Exercises for Section 3.1</h1>

**Exercise 3.1.1:** Divide the following C++ program:

```cpp
float limitedSquare(x) { float x;
  /* returns x-squared, but never more than 100 */
  return (x<=-10.0||x>=10.0)?100:x*x;
}
```
into appropriate lexemes, using the discussion of Section 3.1.2 as a guide.
Which lexemes should get associated lexical values? What should those values be?

**Answer:**
```
<float> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for limitedSquare> 
<(> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x> 
<)> 
<float> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x>
<;>
<{>
<return> 
<(> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x> 
<op,"<="> 
<number, -10.0> 
<op, "||"> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x> 
<op, ">="> 
<number, 10.0> 
<)>
<op, "?"> 
<number, 100> 
<op, ":"> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x> 
<op, "*"> 
<id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x>
<;>
<}>
```

**! Exercise 3.1.2:** Tagged languages like HTML or XML are different from conventional programming languages
in that the punctuation (tags) are either very numerous (as in HTML) or a user-definable set (as in XML).
Further, tags can often have parameters. Suggest how to divide the following HTML document:

```html
Here is a photo of <B>my house</B>:
<P><IMG SRC = "house.gif"><BR>
See <A HREF = "morePix.html">More PictureS</A> if you
liked that one.<P>
```
into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values, and what should those values be?

**Answer:**

```
<text, "Here is a photo of"> 
< < > 
<attribute, "B">
< > >
<text, "my house"> 
< </ >
<attribute, "B">
< > >
<text, ":">
< < >
<attribute, "P">
< > >
< < >
<attribute, "IMG">
<attribute, "SRC">
< = >
<text, "house.gif>
......
```
